<!--Afterburning jet engine. it can do spins really fast. it must have easy stability. and the ability to communicate with Marker for python

Wing: small uav looking wing. high tolerance

no need for this thing to take off. it launchs from a launcher truck

some specs boiii

empty weight: 8000lb

wingspan: 33ft 10inches extended

hight 6ft 8 inches

length 26ft 6inches

no dlhd in wings

single engine thrust vector up to +-10 degress

this drone has the ability to spin very rapidly so little control is needed from tge script

Ground reactions: only one main front one. because this thing launches and... never comes back... 
the 11f variant will neable to take off and land anywhere

The launchertruck launches it at 150kts min power. then it flies its marker points

my computer has enough resources to run around 50 of these

Other stuff
its armament is 4 aim120s. thats it.     oh and a pulse laser   PEWPEWPEWPEWPEWPEWPEQPEWPEWPEWPEWTESTESTESTESTESBOOM

Based off a weapon that i made for the f16 that dropped a small uav. The uav flew to its target and shot it with a laser gun
when the target was destroyed it went and reattached to the host viper via data link. This was tested against 2 OPRF members id 4 and 5. :D they sure seem to like it XD

inorder to be super manuverable ill have to create virtual thrusters to have so much manuverability. g limit will be 29 @ 612kts (M1)

No flares but it does have a low rcs. ill use a random low rcs in the current list

it should have the ability to communicate with others and human jets. Such as calling for back up. i already made a nasal script For raptor to talk to the drone


it should beable todo 4 rolls per second
